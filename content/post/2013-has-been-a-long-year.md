If you're like me, you spend some time on reflecting, what's actually happened in the last year. This involves personal
things and things that may affect the society in general.

## Ambitious OSS projects
What affected me the most in the passing year, was the spirit of Open Source Software.

*Old dishes?* **NO!**

Starting April 2013 or so, i joined the [Fluid powered TYPO3](http://fedext.net) project.
What we are trying to archieve is as simple as it is ambitious:

> Make templating in TYPO3 CMS rock with fluid.

This claim is somehow simple and powerful-but the real thing behind, is the gift of both using powerful tools and actually giving other people the possibility to use them as well, so we can raise the bar once again and be able to construct powerful, TYPO3 CMS-powered sites in a breeze.

And I think we actually made the difference. - There are no hidden treasures in private repos, no exclusive toolchains.. **All in the open.**
This is a both exciting, as well as stunning experience, and tasks vary from supporting users over hacking the code to discussing how we can push the boundaries any further.

> So why don't you contribute to the TYPO3 CMS Core?

One can't do anything and it's more interesting to live on the edge than needing to stuff holes in an old carpet.

### People?

Yessir! The people you work with actually make the difference. Unless you're working from the couch, in the middle of the night, you need someone to talk about your projects, the roadmap, fooling around, misuse as *Karma Buddy*.

In short-Bj√∂rn and Claus; thank you. You know when, where, what.

## Any wishes for the next year?

Sure. I can give you a brief list:

+ peace and harmony for everybody (Just kidding, it's never gonna happen..)
+ more traction for NodeJS in shared hosting environments (Don't ask..)
+ more people that understand, where a *enterprise CMS* makes the difference
+ [insert your point here]

## That's it. - Sorry, couldn't resist

See you on the other side!
